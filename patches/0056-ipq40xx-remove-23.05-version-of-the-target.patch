-Subject: [PATCH 2/2] clk: fix apss cpu overclocking
-
-There's an interaction issue between the clk changes:"
-clk: qcom: ipq4019: Add the apss cpu pll divider clock node
-clk: qcom: ipq4019: remove fixed clocks and add pll clocks
-" and the cpufreq-dt.
-
-cpufreq-dt is now spamming the kernel-log with the following:
-
-[ 1099.190658] cpu cpu0: dev_pm_opp_set_rate: failed to find current OPP
-for freq 761142857 (-34)
-
-This only happens on certain devices like the Compex WPJ428
-and AVM FritzBox!4040. However, other devices like the Asus
-RT-AC58U and Meraki MR33 work just fine.
-
-The issue stem from the fact that all higher CPU-Clocks
-are achieved by switching the clock-parent to the P_DDRPLLAPSS
-(ddrpllapss). Which is set by Qualcomm's proprietary bootcode
-as part of the DDR calibration.
-
-For example, the FB4040 uses 256 MiB Nanya NT5CC128M16IP clocked
-at round 533 MHz (ddrpllsdcc = 190285714 Hz).
-
-whereas the 128 MiB Nanya NT5CC64M16GP-DI in the ASUS RT-AC58U is
-clocked at a slightly higher 537 MHz ( ddrpllsdcc = 192000000 Hz).
-
-This patch attempts to fix the issue by modifying
-clk_cpu_div_round_rate(), clk_cpu_div_set_rate(), clk_cpu_div_recalc_rate()
-to use a new qcom_find_freq_close() function, which returns the closest
-matching frequency, instead of the next higher. This way, the SoC in
-the FB4040 (with its max clock speed of 710.4 MHz) will no longer
-try to overclock to 761 MHz.
-
-Fixes: d83dcacea18 ("clk: qcom: ipq4019: Add the apss cpu pll divider clock node")

-Subject: [PATCH] arm: compressed: add appended DTB section
-
-This adds a appended_dtb section to the ARM decompressor
-linker script.
-
-This allows using the existing ARM zImage appended DTB support for
-appending a DTB to the raw ELF kernel.
-
-Its size is set to 1MB max to match the zImage appended DTB size limit.
-
-To use it to pass the DTB to the kernel, objcopy is used:
-
-objcopy --set-section-flags=.appended_dtb=alloc,contents \
-	--update-section=.appended_dtb=<target>.dtb vmlinux
-
-This is based off the following patch:
-https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/c063e27e02a9dcac0e7f5877fb154e58fa3e1a69

-Subject: [PATCH 2/2] arm: compressed: set ipq40xx watchdog to allow boot
-
-For IPQ40XX systems where the SoC watchdog is activated before linux,
-the watchdog timer may be too small for linux to finish uncompress,
-boot, and watchdog management start.
-If the watchdog is enabled, set the timeout for it to 30 seconds.
-The functionality and offsets were copied from:
-drivers/watchdog/qcom-wdt.c qcom_wdt_set_timeout & qcom_wdt_start
-The watchdog memory address was taken from:
-arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-ipq4019.dtsi
-
-This was required on Mikrotik IPQ40XX consumer hardware using Mikrotik's
-RouterBoot bootloader.

-Subject: [PATCH] skbuff: add DSA specific data to struct skb_shared_info
-
-All of the already existing DSA tagging protocol drivers
-are storing the tagging data directly into the skb. In most
-cases that is the only way to send the required information
-to the underlying ethernet switch.
-
-However on certain platforms (like the Qualcomm IPQ40xx
-SoCs) the built-in ethernet switch is connected directly
-to an ethernet MAC, and the tagging information must be
-sent out-of-band which is done directly via the hardware
-TX descriptors of the ethernet MAC.
-
-In such cases, putting the information into the skb causes
-unneccesary overhead, because the ethernet driver must
-remove that before sending the ethernet frame towards to
-the hardware.
-
-This change adds two new DSA specific fields to struct
-skb_shared_info which makes it possible to send the
-tagging information via skb->shinfo. With this approach,
-the twofold modifications of the skb data can be avoided.

-Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: tag_ipq4019: add shinfo based tagging driver for
- IPQ40xx
-
-This change adds a tagging protocol driver for the built-in
-ethernet switch of the Qualcomm Atheros IPQ4019 SoCs.
-
-In comparison to the existing tagging protocols this hardware
-requires a slightly different approach because the switch does
-not use in-band tags.
-
-On the receive path, the source port information is embedded
-into the RX descriptors of the ethernet MAC hardware. Similarly,
-the destination port mask must be sent via the TX descriptors
-of the ethernet MAC when a packet is sent towards the switch.
-
-In order to support this special requirements, this patch
-adds a new tagging protocol driver.
-
-The driver extracts the source port information directly
-from the 'receive return descriptor' of the ethernet MAC.
-It is possible because that descriptor is part of the skb
-received from the ethernet driver.
-
-Unfortunatley, it is not possible to put the destination
-port information directly to the TX descriptors, because
-those are handled internally by the driver of the ethernet
-hardware.
-
-To overcome this limitation, this tagging driver uses the
-DSA specific fields in skb->shinfo to send the destination
-port information to the ethernet driver.
-
-A similar tagging driver is exist but that uses skb
-extensions which causes unnecessary overhead.

-Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: define PSGMII PHY interface mode
-
-The PSGMII interface is similar to QSGMII. The main difference
-is that the PSGMII interface combines five SGMII lines into a
-single link while in QSGMII only four lines are combined.
-
-Similarly to the QSGMII, this interface mode might also needs
-special handling within the MAC driver.
-
-Add definitions for the PHY layer to allow to express this type
-of connection between the MAC and PHY.

-Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: add Qualcomm IPQ4019 built-in switch support
-
-Qualcomm IPQ40xx SoC-s have a variant of QCA8337N switch built-in.
-
-It shares most of the stuff with its external counterpart, however it is
-modified for the SoC.
-Namely, it doesn't have second CPU port (Port 6), so it has 6 ports
-instead of 7.
-It also has no built-in PHY-s but rather requires external PSGMII based
-companion PHY-s (QCA8072 and QCA8075) for which it first needs to carry
-out calibration before using them.
-PSGMII has a SoC built-in PHY that is used to connect to the PHY-s which
-unfortunately requires some magic values as the datasheet doesnt document
-the bits that are being set or the register at all.
-
-Since its built-in it is MMIO like other peripherals and doesn't have its
-own MDIO bus but depends on the SoC provided one.
-
-CPU connection is at Port 0 and it uses some kind of a internal connection
-and no traditional RGMII/SGMII.
-It also doesn't use in-band tagging like other qca8k switches so a shinfo
-based tagger is used.

-Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: Add Qualcom QCA807x driver
-
-This adds driver for the Qualcomm QCA8072 and QCA8075 PHY-s.
-
-They are 2 or 5 port IEEE 802.3 clause 22 compliant 10BASE-Te, 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T PHY-s.
-
-They feature 2 SerDes, one for PSGMII or QSGMII connection with MAC, while second one is SGMII for connection to MAC or fiber.
-
-Both models have a combo port that supports 1000BASE-X and 100BASE-FX fiber.
-
-Each PHY inside of QCA807x series has 4 digitally controlled output only pins that natively drive LED-s.
-But some vendors used these to driver generic LED-s controlled by userspace,
-so lets enable registering each PHY as GPIO controller and add driver for it.
-
-These are commonly used in Qualcomm IPQ40xx, IPQ60xx and IPQ807x boards.
