Subject: [PATCH 081/115] mtk: mac80211: Fix CAC event call trace

A CAC abort event call trace will occur when deleting the interface
during bootup CAC.
In cfg80211_remove_link, cfg80211_stop_ap will be called to stop the AP,
then the CAC link will be cleared in wdev->valid_links,
and finally ieee80211_link_stop will be called to free the
link-related data.
For cases of deleting the interface during 'runtime' CAC, the CAC abort
event will be handled in cfg80211_stop_ap.
However, for bootup CAC, since the beacon of the link has not been set yet, cfg80211_stop_ap will directly return.
Therefore, the CAC abort event should be handled in ieee80211_link_stop.
When the CAC abort event is handled in ieee80211_link_stop, since the
CAC link is already cleared in wdev->valid_links, the valid_link check
in cfg80211_cac_event will not pass, resulting in a WARN ON and leaving
the cac_started flag set.
To prevent this situation, this patch allows bypassing the valid_link
check for CAC abortion.
The following code flow of cfg80211_cac_event for CAC abortion works
fine when the wdev->valid_link of the CAC abort link truly does not exist.
