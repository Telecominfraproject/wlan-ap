Subject: [PATCH 119/236] mtk: hostapd: do reconnect if receiving CSA during
 association

When receiving CSA event, wpa_s notifies hostapd so that the whole
device can switch to new channel together. However, if the CSA is
received before the association is finished, wpa_s fails to notifies
hostapd since the AP interfaces are disabled. Later the AP interface
setup may fail because wpa_s start up AP interface by old channel
information, which fails kernel's iface_combination check.

This commit triggers a reconnection if CSA is received during
association.
