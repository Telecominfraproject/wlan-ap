Subject: [PATCH 100/236] mtk: hostapd: Fix the op_class value in the RNR IE to
 achieve backward compatibility

According to the chapter 11.49 Reduced neighbor report
of DraftP802.11be_D5.1, the AP should select (one of) the operating
class(es) that is expected to be understood by all STAs that might
intend to connect to the reported AP, even if the channel spacing of
that operating class is less than the BSS bandwidth of all the reported
APs in the Neighbor AP Information field.

For example, if an AP reports an EHT AP that is operating a BSS with 320
MHz bandwidth in 6 GHz band using operating class 137, it is recommended
that the operating class selected by the AP in the Reduced Neighbor Report
element is operating class 131, 132, 133 or 134, since these are expected
to be understood by all STAs that can connect to the reported 6GHz AP.
