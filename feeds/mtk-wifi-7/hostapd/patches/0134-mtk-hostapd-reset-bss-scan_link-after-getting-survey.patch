Subject: [PATCH 134/236] mtk: hostapd: reset bss->scan_link after getting
 survey

The bss->scan_link is used for AP MLD to record the link that
requested the scan. Subsequently, the survey results can be passed
to the "scan_link".
However, not resetting the bss->scan_liunk results in subsequent scans
always pass the result to that "scan_link".
