 * DMAResource_Alloc
 *
 * Allocate a buffer of requested size that can be used for device DMA.
 * DMAResource_Create is used to create a record and handle to administer
 * the buffer.
 *
 * RequestedProperties
 *     Requested properties of the buffer that will be allocated, including
 *     the size, start address alignment, etc. See DMAResource_Properties_t.
 *
 * AddrPair_p (output)
 *     Pointer to the memory location where the address and domain of the
 *     buffer will be written by this function when allocation is successful.
 *     This buffer address can then be used in the caller's memory domain.
 *
 * Handle_p (output)
 *     Pointer to the memory location when the handle will be returned.
 *
 * Return Values
 *     0    Success
 *     <0   Error code (implementation specific)

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DMAResource_CheckAndRegister
 *
 * This function can be used to register an already allocated buffer that the
 * caller wishes to use for DMA. The implementation checks whether the
 * buffer is valid for DMA use. If this test passes, the buffer is registered
 * and can be use as for DMAResource_Alloc and DMAResource_Attach.
 * If the test fails, the buffer is rejected and not registered. The caller
 * will then have to bounce the data to another DMA-safe buffer.
 * The exact conditions for accepting or reject a buffer are implementation
 * specific. Please check the implementation notes.
 *
 * The buffer must be accessible to the caller using the provided address. Use
 * DMAResource_Attach for buffers that are not yet accessible to the caller.
 * It is allowed to register a subset of a DMA resource.
 * DMAResource_Create is used to create a record and handle to administrate
 * the buffer.
 *
 * ActualProperties (input)
 *     Properties that describe the buffer that is being registered.
 *
 * AddrPair (input)
 *     Address and Domain of the buffer. The pointer in this structure must be
 *     valid to use on the host in the domain of the caller.
 *
 * AllocatorRef (input)
 *     Number to describe the source of this buffer. The exact numbers
 *     supported is implementation specific. This provides some flexibility
 *     for a specific implementation to provide address translation for a
 *     number of allocators.
 *
 * Handle_p (output)
 *     Pointer to the memory location when the handle will be returned when
 *     registration is successful.
 *
 * Return Values
 *     1    Rejected; buffer cannot be used for DMA
 *     0    Success
 *     <0   Error code (implementation specific)

 * buffer is available, but not for this memory domain.

 * DMAResource_Release
 *

 * freed, attached buffers are detached and registered buffers are simply
 * forgotten.
 * The caller must ensure the buffers are not in use anymore when this
