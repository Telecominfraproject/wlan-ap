Subject: [PATCH] mesh: Enable 80-160MHz Mesh DFS channels

There are two 80MHz and 160MHz 5G channels are present
in DFS occupied channel list. CAC needs to be performed
before the start of transmission for the DFS channels.
Hostapd CAC check is based on hapd->conf structures.
Hence the center frequency segment index and bandwidth
are added to perform CAC.

Current implementation of DFS channel validatation for
mesh performs DFS check for only primary 80MHz of 160MHz
has DFS channels present or not. But this approach will
fail for channels having Non DFS channel as primary and
DFS channel for secondary 80MHz of 160MHz Eg: channel 36.
To avoid this issue, added DFS check for both primary 80MHz
and secondary 80MHz channels of 160MHz.
