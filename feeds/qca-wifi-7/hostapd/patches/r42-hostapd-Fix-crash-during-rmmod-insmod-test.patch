Subject: [PATCH] hostapd: Fix crash during rmmod insmod test

Hostapd crashes were observed during the rmmod insmod test
when wlan 1 was deleted, and the remaining 14 links failed
to remove. This issue is addressed by ensuring that the link
is part of the list before attempting to delete it.

Fixes: Hostapd crashes during module insertion due to
invalid link deletion.
