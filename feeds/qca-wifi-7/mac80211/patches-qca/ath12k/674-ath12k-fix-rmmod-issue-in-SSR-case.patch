Subject: [PATCH] ath12k: fix rmmod issue in SSR case

Currently, we are calling ath12k_hif_power_down immediate after
ath12k_core_stop function, ath12k_hif_power_down is responsible for
sending mhi_power_off state to firmware by this it's power off one
chip while the core does not stop for other parallel running chips,
due to which other chips receive MHI_CB_EE_RDDM callback.

Hence all other chips are crashing during rmmod

Fix it by calling ath12k_hif_power_down function after stopping core
for all chips.
