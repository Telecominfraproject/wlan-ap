Subject: [PATCH 236/281] net: bridge: don't loopback multicast when hairpin
 enabled

some virtual service test cases need to enable bridge hairpin.
But hairpin will break the DHCP procedure on lan side as follows :
Because the first DHCP discovery packet is a broadcast packet, so this
packet will be loopbacked to switch port 6 which was connected to bridge
member eth1, this will result in a switch fdb entry whose out port is
switch port 6. Then the DHCP ack packet from our board DHCP server will
be dropped by switch because its destination mac hit above switch fdb.
The out port given by the fdb equals to the income port of DHCP ack
packet, so this packet was dropped by switch.

Here forbade multicast to be loopbacked when hairpin enabled.

resolved some confliction and changed the author to resolve the invalid
email
