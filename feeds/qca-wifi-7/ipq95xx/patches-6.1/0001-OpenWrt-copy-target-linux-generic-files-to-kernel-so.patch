+ADM6996FC / ADM6996M switch chip driver
+
+
+1. General information
+
+  This driver supports the FC and M models only. The ADM6996F and L are
+  completely different chips.
+
+  Support for the FC model is extremely limited at the moment. There is no VLAN
+  support as of yet. The driver will not offer an swconfig interface for the FC
+  chip.
+
+1.1 VLAN IDs
+
+  It is possible to define 16 different VLANs. Every VLAN has an identifier, its
+  VLAN ID. It is easiest if you use at most VLAN IDs 0-15. In that case, the
+  swconfig based configuration is very straightforward. To define two VLANs with
+  IDs 4 and 5, you can invoke, for example:
+
+      # swconfig dev ethX vlan 4 set ports '0 1t 2 5t'
+      # swconfig dev ethX vlan 5 set ports '0t 1t 5t'
+
+  The swconfig framework will automatically invoke 'port Y set pvid Z' for every
+  port that is an untagged member of VLAN Y, setting its Primary VLAN ID. In
+  this example, ports 0 and 2 would get "pvid 4". The Primary VLAN ID of a port
+  is the VLAN ID associated with untagged packets coming in on that port.
+
+  But if you wish to use VLAN IDs outside the range 0-15, this automatic
+  behaviour of the swconfig framework becomes a problem. The 16 VLANs that
+  swconfig can configure on the ADM6996 also have a "vid" setting. By default,
+  this is the same as the number of the VLAN entry, to make the simple behaviour
+  above possible. To still support a VLAN with a VLAN ID higher than 15
+  (presumably because you are in a network where such VLAN IDs are already in
+  use), you can change the "vid" setting of the VLAN to anything in the range
+  0-1023. But suppose you did the following:
+
+      # swconfig dev ethX vlan 0 set vid 998
+      # swconfig dev ethX vlan 0 set ports '0 2 5t'
+
+  Now the swconfig framework will issue 'port 0 set pvid 0' and 'port 2 set pvid
+  0'. But the "pvid" should be set to 998, so you are responsible for manually
+  fixing this!
+
+1.2 VLAN filtering
+
+  The switch is configured to apply source port filtering. This means that
+  packets are only accepted when the port the packets came in on is a member of
+  the VLAN the packet should go to.
+
+  Only membership of a VLAN is tested, it does not matter whether it is a tagged
+  or untagged membership.
+
+  For untagged packets, the destination VLAN is the Primary VLAN ID of the
+  incoming port. So if the PVID of a port is 0, but that port is not a member of
+  the VLAN with ID 0, this means that untagged packets on that port are dropped.
+  This can be used as a roundabout way of dropping untagged packets from a port,
+  a mode often referred to as "Admit only tagged packets".
+
+1.3 Reset
+
+  The two supported chip models do not have a sofware-initiated reset. When the
+  driver is initialised, as well as when the 'reset' swconfig option is invoked,
+  the driver will set those registers it knows about and supports to the correct
+  default value. But there are a lot of registers in the chip that the driver
+  does not support. If something changed those registers, invoking 'reset' or
+  performing a warm reboot might still leave the chip in a "broken" state. Only
+  a hardware reset will bring it back in the default state.
+
+2. Technical details on PHYs and the ADM6996
+
+  From the viewpoint of the Linux kernel, it is common that an Ethernet adapter
+  can be seen as a separate MAC entity and a separate PHY entity. The PHY entity
+  can be queried and set through registers accessible via an MDIO bus. A PHY
+  normally has a single address on that bus, in the range 0 through 31.
+
+  The ADM6996 has special-purpose registers in the range of PHYs 0 through 10.
+  Even though all these registers control a single ADM6996 chip, the Linux
+  kernel treats this as 11 separate PHYs.  The driver will bind to these
+  addresses to prevent a different PHY driver from binding and corrupting these
+  registers.
+
+  What Linux sees as the PHY on address 0 is meant for the Ethernet MAC
+  connected to the CPU port of the ADM6996 switch chip (port 5). This is the
+  Ethernet MAC you will use to send and receive data through the switch.
+
+  The PHYs at addresses 16 through 20 map to the PHYs on ports 0 through 4 of
+  the switch chip. These can be accessed with the Generic PHY driver, as the
+  registers have the common layout.
+
+  If a second Ethernet MAC on your board is wired to the port 4 PHY, that MAC
+  needs to bind to PHY address 20 for the port to work correctly.
+
+  The ADM6996 switch driver will reset the ports 0 through 3 on startup and when
+  'reset' is invoked. This could clash with a different PHY driver if the kernel
+  binds a PHY driver to address 16 through 19.
+
+  If Linux binds a PHY on addresses 1 through 10 to an Ethernet MAC, the ADM6996
+  driver will simply always report a connected 100 Mbit/s full-duplex link for
+  that PHY, and provide no other functionality. This is most likely not what you
+  want. So if you see a message in your log
+
+	ethX: PHY overlaps ADM6996, providing fixed PHY yy.
+
+  This is most likely an indication that ethX will not work properly, and your
+  kernel needs to be configured to attach a different PHY to that Ethernet MAC.
+
+  Controlling the mapping between MACs and PHYs is usually done in platform- or
+  board-specific fixup code. The ADM6996 driver has no influence over this.

+ *
+ * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
+ * under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published
+ * by the Free Software Foundation.
+ *
+ * This parser builds from the "fixed-partitions" one (see ofpart.c), but it can
+ * handle dynamic partitions as found on routerboot devices.
+ *
+ * DTS nodes are defined as follows:
+ * For fixed partitions:
+ *	node-name@unit-address {
+ *		reg = <prop-encoded-array>;
+ *		label = <string>;
+ *		read-only;
+ *		lock;
+ *	};
+ *
+ * reg property is mandatory; other properties are optional.
+ * reg format is <address length>. length can be 0 if the next partition is
+ * another fixed partition or a "well-known" partition as defined below: in that
+ * case the partition will extend up to the next one.
+ *
+ * For dynamic partitions:
+ *	node-name {
+ *		size = <prop-encoded-array>;
+ *		label = <string>;
+ *		read-only;
+ *		lock;
+ *	};
+ *
+ * size property is normally mandatory. It can only be omitted (or set to 0) if:
+ *	- the partition is a "well-known" one (as defined below), in which case
+ *	  the partition size will be automatically adjusted; or
+ *	- the next partition is a fixed one or a "well-known" one, in which case
+ *	  the current partition will extend up to the next one.
+ * Other properties are optional.
+ * size format is <length>.
+ * By default dynamic partitions are appended after the preceding one, except
+ * for "well-known" ones which are automatically located on flash.
+ *
+ * Well-known partitions (matched via label or node-name):
+ * - "hard_config"
+ * - "soft_config"
+ * - "dtb_config"
+ *
+ * Note: this parser will happily register 0-sized partitions if misused.
+ *
+ * This parser requires the DTS to list partitions in ascending order as
+ * expected on the MTD device.
+ *
+ * Since only the "hard_config" and "soft_config" partitions are used in OpenWRT,
+ * a minimal working DTS could define only these two partitions dynamically (in
+ * the right order, usually hard_config then soft_config).
+ *
+ * Note: some mips RB devices encode the hard_config offset and length in two
+ * consecutive u32 located at offset 0x14 (for ramips) or 0x24 (for ath79) on
+ * the SPI NOR flash. Unfortunately this seems inconsistent across machines and
+ * does not apply to e.g. ipq-based ones, so we ignore that information.
+ *
+ * Note: To find well-known partitions, this parser will go through the entire
+ * top mtd partition parsed, _before_ the DTS nodes are processed. This works
+ * well in the current state of affairs, and is a simpler implementation than
+ * searching for known partitions in the "holes" left between fixed-partition,
+ * _after_ processing DTS nodes.

+ * This driver exposes the data encoded in the "soft_config" flash segment of
+ * MikroTik RouterBOARDs devices. It presents the data in a sysfs folder
+ * named "soft_config". The data is presented in a user/machine-friendly way
+ * with just as much parsing as can be generalized across mikrotik platforms
+ * (as inferred from reverse-engineering).
+ *
+ * The known soft_config tags are presented in the "soft_config" sysfs folder,
+ * with the addition of one specific file named "commit", which is only
+ * available if the driver supports writes to the mtd device: no modifications
+ * made to any of the other attributes are actually written back to flash media
+ * until a true value is input into this file (e.g. [Yy1]). This is to avoid
+ * unnecessary flash wear, and to permit to revert all changes by issuing a
+ * false value ([Nn0]). Reading the content of this file shows the current
+ * status of the driver: if the data in sysfs matches the content of the
+ * soft_config partition, the file will read "clean". Otherwise, it will read
+ * "dirty".
+ *
+ * The writeable sysfs files presented by this driver will accept only inputs
+ * which are in a valid range for the given tag. As a design choice, the driver
+ * will not assess whether the inputs are identical to the existing data.
+ *
+ * Note: PAGE_SIZE is assumed to be >= 4K, hence the device attribute show
+ * routines need not check for output overflow.

+ *	(Linux) kernel image and one or more data images like
+ *	RAMDisks. This construct is useful for instance when you want
+ *	to boot over the network using BOOTP etc., where the boot
+ *	server provides just a single image file, but you want to get
+ *	for instance an OS kernel and a RAMDisk image.
+ *
+ *	"Multi-File Images" start with a list of image sizes, each
+ *	image size (in bytes) specified by an "uint32_t" in network
+ *	byte order. This list is terminated by an "(uint32_t)0".
+ *	Immediately after the terminating 0 follow the images, one by
+ *	one, all aligned on "uint32_t" boundaries (size rounded up to
+ *	a multiple of 4 bytes - except for the last file).
+ *
+ * "Firmware Images" are binary images containing firmware (like
+ *	U-Boot or FPGA images) which usually will be programmed to
+ *	flash memory.
+ *
+ * "Script files" are command sequences that will be executed by
+ *	U-Boot's command interpreter; this feature is especially
+ *	useful when you configure U-Boot to use a real shell (hush)
+ *	as command interpreter (=> Shell Scripts).
+ *
+ * The following are exposed to uImage header.
+ * New IDs *MUST* be appended at the end of the list and *NEVER*
+ * inserted for backward compatibility.
