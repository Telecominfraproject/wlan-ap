Subject: [PATCH 233/281] net: Export dev_shutdown()

This API is needed by interface drivers to ensure qdiscs are destroyed
before the NSS interfaces are destroyed. Since Linux destroys qdiscs
only at unregister_netdevice(), it is too late for destroying any NSS
qdiscs that may be configured on the interface.
