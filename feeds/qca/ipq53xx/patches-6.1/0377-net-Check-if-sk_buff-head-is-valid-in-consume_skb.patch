Subject: [PATCH] net: Check if sk_buff head is valid in consume_skb()

Commit (0ebd0ac net: add function to allocate sk_buff head
without data area) changes skb_release_all() to check if the
skb has a data area to allow the skb destructor to clear the
data pointer in case only a head has been allocated.

This was later fixed to check skb->head instead of skb->data
in 'commit 5e71d9d77c07 ("net: fix sk_buff head without data area")'.
as skb->head points to the beginning of the data area.

Since, this was done only in kfree_skb path and not in consume_skb
path, this leads to kernel panic in some cases.

Also, since skb_shared_info is not initialized in such skbs,
accessing that in skb_recycler_consume() leads to kernel panic.

Fix this by checking if skb->head is valid in both the cases.
