Subject: [PATCH] bus: mhi: Changed IRQ_HANDLED to IRQ_NONE in mhi_irq_handler

This patch changes the IRQ_HANDLED return value to IRQ_NONE,
if there is no pending event in the event ring to be handled.

In case of shared interrupt, kernel will invokes all handlers
registered for the particular interrupt with unique dev_id(in our
case it is mhi_event), and its shared handlers responsibility to
identify its own interrupt and exits quickly if not.

In our case, we are exiting the mhi_irq_handler if there is no pending
events in that particular event ring. So the return ideally should be
IRQ_NONE which denotes interrupt was not from this device or was not handled.
