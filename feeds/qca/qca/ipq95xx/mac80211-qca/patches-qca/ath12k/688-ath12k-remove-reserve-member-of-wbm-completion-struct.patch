Subject: [PATCH] ath12k: remove reserve member of wbm completion structure

In tx completion, status desc obtained from offsetting the address from wbm ring.
Having reserved 8 bytes in status desc offsets the address twice and read the
values from the incorrect address. So, removing the reserved 8 bytes from  wbm
completion structure.

Fixes: I42879fea("ath12k: update htt_tx_wbm_completion descriptor to version 3")
